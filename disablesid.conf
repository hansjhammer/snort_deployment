# Example of modifying state for MS and cve rules, note the use of the : 
# in cve. This will modify MS09-008, cve 2009-0233, bugtraq 21301,
# and all MS00 and all cve 2000 related sids!  These support regular expression
# matching only after you have specified what you are looking for, i.e. 
# MS00-<regex> or cve:<regex>, the first section CANNOT contain a regular
# expression (MS\d{2}-\d+) will NOT work, use the pcre: keyword (below)
# for this.
# MS09-008,cve:2009-0233,bugtraq:21301,MS00-\d+,cve:2000-\d+

# Example of using the pcre: keyword to modify rulestate.  the pcre keyword 
# allows for full use of regular expression syntax, you do not need to designate
# with / and all pcre searches are treated as case insensitive. For more information 
# about regular expression syntax: http://www.regular-expressions.info/
# The following example modifies state for all MS07 through MS10 
# pcre:MS(0[7-9]|10)-\d+

# Example of modifying state for specific categories entirely (see README.CATEGORIES)
# VRT-web-iis,ET-shellcode,ET-emergingthreats-smtp,Custom-shellcode,Custom-emergingthreats-smtp

# Any of the above values can be on a single line or multiple lines, when 
# on a single line they simply need to be separated by a ,
# 1:9837,1:220-1:3264,3:13010-3:13013,pcre:MS(0[0-7])-\d+,MS09-008,cve:2009-0233
